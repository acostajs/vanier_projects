# Proof of Concept: Staff Scheduling & Performance Tracking

## Overview
This project explores automating staff scheduling and performance tracking for Pozole restaurant. The goal is to optimize scheduling, reduce labor costs, and improve efficiency using automated scheduling and real-time performance monitoring.

## Problem Statement
Manual scheduling leads to inefficiencies, such as overstaffing during slow periods and understaffing during peak hours. Additionally, there is no clear system to track employee performance, making it difficult to reward high performers or address inefficiencies.

## Key Features
- **Automated Scheduling** – Assigns shifts based on predicted customer demand.
- **Performance Tracking** – Monitors employee efficiency, mistake rates, and attendance.
- **Real-Time Insights** – Generates reports on labor costs and staff productivity.
- **Payroll & Attendance Integration** – Ensures accurate tracking of hours worked.
- **Shift Notifications** – Notifies employees of updated schedules.
